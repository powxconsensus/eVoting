# About the project 
The proposed eVoting system is a blockchain-based solution built on the Polygon network. It eliminates the need for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) by utilizing the COMMIT-REVEAL mechanism, ensuring scalability and efficiency. By leveraging the transparent nature of blockchain technology, the system offers a secure and tamper-proof voting environment. Through decentralized consensus, the system enables trust in the voting process and prevents manipulation of results. Leveraging the advantages of Polygon's network, the design provides a fast and cost-effective platform for conducting elections. With its focus on addressing the limitations of traditional voting systems, this solution aims to deliver a transparent, scalable, and efficient eVoting system that can enhance the integrity and accessibility of democratic processes.
